# Sunshine Medical Manager - CS340 Project
## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a web-based interface to a database to address a hypothetical, but applicable, problem. 

Sunshine Medical currently provides care for 2,300 patients per year through a variety of services including primary/urgent care, laboratory testing, and imaging. Hospital management has determined that inefficiencies in patient testing and imaging are contributing to a growing patient backlog. If resolved, Sunshine Medical projects that it has the operational capacity to provide quality care for upwards of 10,000 patients per year.

The Sunhine Medical Manager aims to address these issues by implementing a website driven database to record and prioritize patients for testing in their respective departments.

Project was worked on with Lamary Petty (voyagerfan - https://github.com/voyagerfan)
